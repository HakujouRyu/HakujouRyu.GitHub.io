# TwitOff
A fun web App for comparing and predicting Tweets

## [Found Here](https://hakujouryu-twitoff.herokuapp.com/)

Here I built a simple web app utilising [Basilica](https://www.basilica.ai/) Embeddings to enable a Logistic Regression model to predict who would be most likely to tweet a given text.
To use the app, you simply add some users, then supply some text to see who is more likely to tweet what you've typed in!

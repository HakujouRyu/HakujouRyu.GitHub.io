# People say your first programming language is the hardest.

I can now say that I whoeheartedly agree. Over the weekend, I decided that I would dip into the world of game development. 
It was a BLAST! I started of by downloading Unity. From there I played around with their tutorials. That was awful. 

### So, I decided to build a thing.

I built a galaxy shooter game. I learned a lot this weekend, I learned the basics of C# and Unity, The basics of game design,
and I also learned that game development takes longer than I expected! Though, I will say that it was very rewarding. 
When it was time to ship the V1.0 of my game I was elated. 

I have pushed it to GitHub, (obviously) but I also ported it to WebGL so that you can play it too! >> [HERE](http://www.claywaddell.com/Games/GalaxyShooter/) <<

The controls are simple: WASD and SPACE.  The gameplay loop fully starts once you destroy the asteroid. (You monster)
You may pause the game by pressing ESC or P. Have fun, and please hit me with any bugs you find! :) 

Now to be fair, I did take a course to help facilitate this. I did not however follow a code along. 99% of this code was googled by yours truly. Plus, I changed some things.
